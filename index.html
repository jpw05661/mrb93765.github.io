<td><p> My name is Michael Buhler and I am a 4th year Fisheries major in <b>Warnell School of Natural Resources</b> and pursuing a minor in business
	through <b>Terry College of Business</b>. I am from Dacula, Georgia and graduated from Archer High School in 2016. I like hunting, fishing, 
	and loving everyday. I currently have two job; one at a clothing store and the other at a bar. On the weekends I like to drink ungodly amounts 
	of alcohol on the weekends and cheer on the Silver Britches during football season. I really enjoying listeing to music and listen to a 
	variety of genres from country, rap, and classic rock. </p>                                                       
	
						     
<p> My favorite musicians right now are:</p>
<ol>
	    <li> The Eagles</li>
	    <li> Turpike Troubadors</li>
	    <li> Lynard Skynyrd</li>
	    <li> Tyler Childers</li>
	    <li> Da Baby</li>	
	    </ol>

	    
<p> My dream for the future is to one day own my own charter fishing boat and take people deep-sea fishing on my boat named <i>Brandy</i>. If that does not 
work out, I hope to be the first person to raise and domesticate Great White Sharks. After I succesfully domesticate the species, I plan to start the world's 
first shark rodeo, where anyone that survives wins 1 million dollars.</p>
